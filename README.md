### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I'm Imran Hossen
#### An EduTech undergraduate student


I'm an EduTech undergraduate student on a mission to revolutionize education through technology.

Education is my passion, and I believe in its transformative power. As an EduTech enthusiast, I am committed to bridging the gap between traditional learning and modern technology to make education accessible and engaging for all.

 When I'm not in the classroom or studying, I'm immersed in the world of app development. I design and build digital solutions that enhance the learning experience, striving to create user-friendly, innovative applications.

In addition to app development, I have a keen interest in 3D educational content creation. I'm fascinated by the potential of immersive experiences to captivate learners and facilitate deeper understanding.

Join me on my journey as I code, design, and create educational solutions that push the boundaries of what's possible in the EduTech space. Let's collaborate and make learning an exciting adventure!

Skills: C / Python / Java / PHP / JS / HTML / CSS
